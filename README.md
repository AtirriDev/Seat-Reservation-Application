# Seat-Reservation-Application
Logic Exercise in C# .NET, console application. This app is inspired by the seat reservation in a cinema/theater.
Instructions:
Imagine a seat reservation system for an amphitheater/cinema. The theater has 10 rows with 10 seats each.
A system needs to be developed (without the use of a database, only logical data management). The system should perform the following:

1-Load the 'Map' of rows and seats, indicating with the letter 'L' for available seats and 'R' for reserved seats.
The loading should occur at the beginning of the system, and all seats should be loaded as available ('L').

2-Manage seat reservations, considering that a seat can only be reserved if it is available. In case it's already taken, display a message and allow the user to choose another one.
If the seat is available and selected, it should automatically change from the 'L' state to the 'R' state.

3-Ensure that seats cannot be sold outside the range of rows and seats, and overbooking is not allowed.

4-If requested by the customer, it should be possible to view available seats graphically without the use of a graphical interface, only with logic and console output."
